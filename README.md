This repository is used for my testing to learn basics
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.
